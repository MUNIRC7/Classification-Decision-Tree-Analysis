Decision Tree Classification Analysis
Welcome to the Decision Tree Classification Analysis repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use decision tree classification to predict categories of vertebrate species based on their characteristics.

Prerequisites
Before you run the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Decision Tree Modeling: Constructs and trains a decision tree classifier.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the accuracy, precision, and recall of the classifier.
Visualization: Includes visual representations of data distributions and the decision tree.
