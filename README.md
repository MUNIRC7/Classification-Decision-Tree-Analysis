Decision Tree Classification Analysis
Welcome to the Decision Tree Classification Analysis repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use decision tree classification to predict categories of vertebrate species based on their characteristics.

Prerequisites
Before you run the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

Copy code
git clone [your-repository-url]
Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash
Copy code
cd [your-repository-name]
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Classification_Decision_Tree_Analysis.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Decision Tree Modeling: Constructs and trains a decision tree classifier.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the accuracy, precision, and recall of the classifier.
Visualization: Includes visual representations of data distributions and the decision tree.
